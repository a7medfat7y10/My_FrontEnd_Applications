                                EEGS Suez University Student Chapter is a society of professional excellence, providing its members with the highest quality lifelong learning and continuous personal and professional growth. We are looking for development of the students to keep up with the latest technology in the field of petroleum and geology to reduce the gap between the educational life and practical life.
                                After hard working through our Second season we put a good fingerprint in our university by providing technical, nontechnical events and training opportunities to support all students and keep them updated with all technologies related to the oil and gas industry.
                                And now we are looking forward to powering our second season to help our students to get the maximum benefits.
